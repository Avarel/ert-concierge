# ERT / Basic Physics Simulation
Simulates the motion of bodies under gravity and linear momentum conservation (no rotation! Sorry.). Adapted from the C physics engine written in CS3, rewritten in Rust to take advantage of multithreading.

The physics simulation also allows for one basic interaction: clicking on the boxes will cycle between 3 colors. Everyone should see the same color.
